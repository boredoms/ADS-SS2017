# ADS-SS2017
This repo contains the code for the B+-tree assignment from the Algorithms and Data Structures (ADS) course at the University of Vienna

It is fully working, passes all unit tests on the site and has average performance. The design of the tree algorithms is fully recursive, with all tree nodes being allocated in heap memory.
